Custom Home Assistant integration for Dreame and MOVA robotic lawn mowers.

The integration uses the cloud/app protocol exposed by Dreamehome and MOVAhome.
It is being developed against real A2-family hardware and is intentionally
conservative with anything that can move the mower or change mower settings.

## Status

This project is usable, but still young. Core mower state, controls, schedules,
maps, and diagnostics are available. Some features remain diagnostic or
disabled by default while the protocol is validated across more models.

## Support Matrix

Support levels in this table mean:

- `Validated`: exercised against real hardware and fixtures in this repository
- `Recognized`: model strings, account types, or rebadges are known and should
  degrade gracefully, but still need more real-world confirmation
- `Needs reports`: intended target, but not yet proven enough to claim support

| Scope | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dreame A2 (`dreame.mower.g2408`) | Validated | Primary live development device, including schedules, maps, remote control, guarded preference writes, and diagnostics |
| MOVA LiDAX Ultra 1000 (`mova.mower.g2529c`) | Recognized | Added from a MOVAhome EU diagnostics report; commands and battery are reported working, state handling now accepts model-specific cloud property ids |
| Dreame A3 AWD Pro 3500 (`dreame.mower.g2541e`) | Recognized | Added from a Dreamehome EU diagnostics report; needs broader live confirmation before it is considered validated |
| Newer A-series mower (`dreame.mower.g3255`) | Recognized | Raw model has been observed in code mapping, but the public retail name is still unverified |
| Dreame A1 (`dreame.mower.p2255`) | Recognized | Model mapping is present; needs fixtures and live validation |
| Dreame A1 Pro (`dreame.mower.g2422`) | Recognized | Model mapping is present; needs fixtures and live validation |
| MOVAhome accounts | Recognized | Login flow and account type are supported; needs broader live confirmation |
| MOVA-branded mower rebadges | Needs reports | Expected to follow the same protocol family, but still needs sanitized fixtures and user reports |
| Regional / firmware variants of known A-series models | Needs reports | Should avoid crashing, but behavior can still vary by firmware and region |

Current live validation is still centered on:

- Dreamehome account in the EU region
- A2-family hardware

If you have a mower model not listed as `Validated`, please open an issue or PR.
Model reports with sanitized diagnostics, screenshots, raw model identifiers, and
region/account details are especially helpful for moving a device from
`Recognized` or `Needs reports` to `Validated`.

## Not Yet Public-Ready Features

The following areas are intentionally cautious:

- firmware OTA now exposes a Home Assistant update entity using the app's
  approved `checkDeviceVersion` target and `manualFirmwareUpdate` approval
  step, but release notes remain best-effort because the live A2 endpoint still
  embeds a `missing lang` error string in the changelog field
  the live Dreame A2 verification on April 22, 2026 completed from
  `4.3.6_0320` to `4.3.6_0447`
- a read-only debug OTA catalog probe exists for version-trace work, but it is
  not treated as authoritative latest-version, changelog, or install approval
  data because it is a manual catalog rather than the mobile app's approved OTA
  response
- firmware diagnostics now include those debug-catalog candidate versions when
  available, so operation snapshots can show plausible newer builds without
  conflating them with the app-approved update target
- rain-protection writes are not exposed yet
- mowing-preference writes are guarded, validated on a supervised A2 no-op write, and still need broader model and firmware validation
- map rendering is read-only; no-go editing, virtual-wall editing, and other map
  editing flows are not exposed yet
- camera/photo/video paths are probe-only until runtime safety is clearer
- 3D map object downloads are metadata-first and not treated as stable
- manual driving must stay supervised and uses strict state and battery guards

## Installation

### HACS

1. Add this repository to HACS as a custom integration repository:

   [![Open your Home Assistant instance and open this repository inside HACS.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=EvotecIT&repository=homeassistant-dreamelawnmower&category=integration)

   If the button does not open your Home Assistant instance, manually add this
   repository URL in HACS:

   `https://github.com/EvotecIT/homeassistant-dreamelawnmower`

2. Install **Dreame Lawn Mower** from HACS.
3. Restart Home Assistant.
4. Add the integration from **Settings -> Devices & services**:

   [![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up Dreame Lawn Mower.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=dreame_lawn_mower)

### Manual

Copy `custom_components/dreame_lawn_mower` into your Home Assistant
`custom_components` directory, restart Home Assistant, then add the integration
from the UI.

## Configuration

The config flow asks for:

- account type: `dreame` or `mova`
- country/region
- username
- password

The integration stores Home Assistant config-entry data only. Do not put
credentials into repository files, fixtures, or issue attachments.

## Help Expand Support

Support across Dreame, MOVA, and rebadged mower variants will improve fastest
with real-world reports. If your mower is recognized but not yet validated, or
if it exposes a different raw model string than this README shows, please open a
GitHub issue or PR with:

- the retail product name and raw app/cloud model identifier
- account type (`dreame` or `mova`) and region
- a sanitized diagnostics capture or Home Assistant debug snapshot
- screenshots of the product page, app model name, or device information page
- notes about what works, what is missing, and any errors you see

Please redact credentials, tokens, serial numbers, exact coordinates, and any
other secrets before attaching files.

## Entities

The primary entity is:

- `lawn_mower.<device>`

Common user-facing helpers include:

- `sensor.<device>_activity`
- `sensor.<device>_state_name`
- `sensor.<device>_error`
- `sensor.<device>_battery`
- `sensor.<device>_mowing_progress`
- `sensor.<device>_selected_mowing_action`
- `sensor.<device>_selected_map`
- `sensor.<device>_selected_target`
- `sensor.<device>_selected_zone_mowing_height`
- `sensor.<device>_selected_zone_efficiency_mode`
- `sensor.<device>_selected_zone_direction_mode`
- `sensor.<device>_selected_zone_obstacle_avoidance`
- `sensor.<device>_selected_zone_obstacle_distance`
- `sensor.<device>_selected_zone_obstacle_height`
- `sensor.<device>_selected_zone_obstacle_classes`
- `sensor.<device>_runtime_mission_progress`
- `sensor.<device>_runtime_current_area`
- `sensor.<device>_runtime_total_area`
- `sensor.<device>_runtime_live_track_length`
- `sensor.<device>_runtime_live_track_point_count`
- `sensor.<device>_last_known_position`
- `sensor.<device>_position_last_updated`
- `sensor.<device>_weather_protection_status`
- `select.<device>_map`
- `select.<device>_mowing_action`
- `select.<device>_edge`
- `select.<device>_zone`
- `select.<device>_spot`
- `binary_sensor.<device>_docked`
- `binary_sensor.<device>_charging`
- `binary_sensor.<device>_bluetooth_connected`
- `binary_sensor.<device>_mowing`
- `binary_sensor.<device>_task_active`
- `binary_sensor.<device>_task_resumable`
- `binary_sensor.<device>_rain_delay_active`
- `binary_sensor.<device>_returning`
- `calendar.<device>_schedule`

Many reverse-engineering and validation helpers are disabled by default. Enable
them from the entity registry only when troubleshooting:

- map and all-map cameras
- map diagnostics camera
- runtime pose / heading / segment-count sensors
- all-schedules calendar
- rain delay end time sensor
- last schedule probe/write sensors
- last task-status, weather, and preference probe sensors
- raw vendor flag sensors
- manual-drive safety diagnostics

### Last Known Position

When the mower hits an error and powers down before you notice, it drops off
the Dreame cloud and the native app can no longer show where it is. The
integration keeps its own record so you can still find the robot:

- `sensor.<device>_last_known_position` retains the last reported map-grid
  coordinates (`x, y`) and stays available while the mower is offline. Its
  attributes include the heading, the capture source, and the activity and
  error state at the moment of capture, plus `device_currently_online` so
  automations can tell a live fix from a retained one.
- `sensor.<device>_position_last_updated` is a timestamp sensor showing how
  old the fix is (Home Assistant renders it as "23 minutes ago").
- The rendered map draws the retained fix as an orange ring (a solid dot means
  live telemetry), so the last known location is visible on the map even when
  the mower is idle, in an error state, or offline. The map camera prefers the
  vector map view whenever a position marker can be drawn.
- The map cameras keep serving their last rendered frame — including the
  position marker — while the mower is offline instead of becoming unavailable.

The position sensors are persisted to disk and survive Home Assistant
restarts. The cached camera frame is in-memory only, so after a restart the
map image is unavailable until the mower comes back online, while the
coordinate sensors still show the retained fix.

## Schedules And Multiple Maps

Dreame A2 schedules can exist in more than one slot. Live captures have shown a
default schedule plus per-map schedules. The normal Home Assistant `Schedule`
calendar follows the active schedule version reported by the mower's `SCHDT`
response, so hidden/default/other-map schedules do not appear as normal mowing
events.

Enable the disabled `All Schedules` calendar only when you intentionally want to
inspect every decoded schedule slot.

The guarded `dreame_lawn_mower.set_schedule_plan_enabled` service is dry-run
first. It sends a write only when both `execute: true` and
`confirm_schedule_write: true` are set.

`dreame_lawn_mower.plan_mowing_preference_update` is dry-run first. It reads
the current app preference payload, applies the requested field changes
locally, and exposes the candidate `PRE` request in a notification plus the
disabled-by-default `Last Preference Write` diagnostic sensor. It sends a live
preference write only when both `execute: true` and
`confirm_preference_write: true` are provided.

The guarded preference fields include per-zone safe edge mowing through
`edge_mowing_safe`. Use the dry-run result to inspect the candidate payload
before confirming a live write.

## Maps

The map camera uses the confirmed app-map JSON path first. The renderer is
read-only and produces a simple Home Assistant camera image from the decoded map
payload.

If the mower has multiple maps, enable the disabled `All Maps` camera to render
a contact sheet. Use `Map Diagnostics` when the map image is missing or when you
need source, counts, and parser evidence.

Current map support now includes:

- a read-only `Map` camera for the active map
- a read-only `All Maps` contact sheet for quick map inventory
- `select` entities for map, mowing action, edge, zone, and spot scope
- services for switching the active mower map and starting explicit zone, spot,
  or edge jobs
- runtime live-track telemetry surfaced through sensors and map-camera attributes
- circular and rotated rectangular forbidden areas rendered from their compact
  mower map representation

Interactive map editing is still intentionally out of scope for now:

- no-go editing
- virtual-wall editing
- zone geometry edits
- other direct map mutations

## Services

The integration now exposes guarded current-map services on the `lawn_mower`
entity:

- `dreame_lawn_mower.switch_current_map`
- `dreame_lawn_mower.start_zone_mowing`
- `dreame_lawn_mower.start_spot_mowing`
- `dreame_lawn_mower.start_edge_mowing`

These use current decoded app-map and vector-map metadata. Map switching updates
the real active mower map, while zone, spot, and edge starts target explicit
current-map ids rather than relying only on the generic Home Assistant
`start_mowing` action.

## Troubleshooting

Start with Home Assistant diagnostics:

1. Open the device page.
2. Download diagnostics.
3. Check the `triage`, `state_reconciliation`, schedule, and map sections.

For issue reports, include:

- mower model and app/account type
- firmware version
- normalized activity/state/error values
- relevant diagnostic payload sections with secrets redacted
- whether the issue happens while docked, mowing, returning, raining, or charging

Home Assistant log lines that start with `Captured Dreame lawn mower ...` can be
converted to JSON with:

```bash
python examples/extract_ha_payload.py home-assistant.log --summary
```

## Reusable Python Package

This repository ships two usable layers:

- `dreame_lawn_mower_client` for direct Python access to Dreame/MOVA mower
  cloud, app-action, schedule, map, and diagnostic APIs
- the Home Assistant integration in `custom_components/dreame_lawn_mower`

Library docs: [docs/python-library.md](docs/python-library.md)

Runnable example: [examples/python_client.py](examples/python_client.py)

Example:

```python
from dreame_lawn_mower_client import DreameLawnMowerClient

devices = await DreameLawnMowerClient.async_discover_devices(
    username=username,
    password=password,
    country="eu",
    account_type="dreame",
)

client = DreameLawnMowerClient(
    username=username,
    password=password,
    country="eu",
    account_type="dreame",
    descriptor=devices[0],
)
snapshot = await client.async_refresh()
print(snapshot.descriptor.title, snapshot.state_name, snapshot.battery_level)
```

The Home Assistant integration uses the same client package name inside the
custom component bundle, so HACS installs the protocol layer together with the
integration while scripts and tests can still import `dreame_lawn_mower_client`
directly.

## Development

Install development dependencies:

```bash
python -m pip install -e .[test]
```

Run checks:

```bash
python -m compileall dreame_lawn_mower_client custom_components tests examples
pytest
```

Useful docs:

- [Python library](docs/python-library.md)
- [Development notes](docs/development.md)
- [Roadmap](docs/roadmap.md)
- [Dreamehome protocol research](docs/dreamehome-research.md)
- [Agent handoff notes](docs/agent-handoff.md)

## Safety

Read-only probes are preferred. Anything that can move the mower or write mower
settings must remain supervised, explicitly confirmed, and safe-state guarded.
